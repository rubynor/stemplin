# How to contribute
## Reporting an issue üêõ
* **Do not open GitHub Issues for security vulnerabilities**. If you find a security vulnerability, please send an email to security@stemplin.com that explains the issue.
* Before opening an Issue, make sure that what you are reporting is not already dealt with in any existing Issues.
* To report a bug, use the bug report template.
* To request a feature, use the feature request template.
## Creating a Pull Request :octocat:
* New Pull Requests should always address an existing Issue.
* Short Pull Requests are GOLDEN. Make them easy to read and fast to review.
* When naming variables and methods, pick a name that is easy to pronounce, and that is self explaining. Stay away from abbreviations.
